\page page_design Design & Implementation
Table of contents
The following developer's notes give a more or less detailed description of how we have implemented the SP method in KAPSEL, they were written with the aim of bridging the gap between the papers and the actual code. Although we have tried to use a consistent notation throughout this was not strictly enforced, the different sections should be considered self-contained and independent of each other. If you feel some part is missing, or incomplete, please help us make this guide better!
